# DK Icon Lib
DO NOT USE

These are just internal notes, I take notes a lot.

## Icon format

- 512x512 - tilt any rectangular shape to make it fit diagonally.
- Set stroke to 10px.
- Round all the stroke ends and corners

In Inkscape:
- Document settings, set dimensions, set units to px
- Set the viewBox to 512x512 too
- Create guides in the middle of the documents; It's very important to start there
- WHEN A PATH IS FINISHED FILL IT IMMEDIATELY

## Colors
